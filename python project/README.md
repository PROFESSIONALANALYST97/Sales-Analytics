Global Retail Sales Analysis (Python & Pandas)
Project Overview
Comprehensive analysis of a global retail dataset covering multiple years of sales across physical and online stores. The project focuses on data cleaning, integration, and extracting actionable business insights.

Key Features & Workflow
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, identified anomalies, and normalized string data (handling casing and special characters).

Data Integration: Merged three relational datasets (events, products, countries) into a unified DataFrame for holistic analysis.

Business Logic & KPIs: Calculated total revenue, profit margins, and order volumes to evaluate company performance.

Visualizations: Created insightful charts using Seaborn and Matplotlib to show sales dynamics by region, product category, and sales channel.

Logistics Analysis: Investigated the time gap between order and shipment to identify bottlenecks in the supply chain.

Temporal Trends: Analyzed sales performance by day of the week and identified seasonal patterns.
