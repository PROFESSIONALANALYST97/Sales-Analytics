# A/B Test Analysis: Website Conversion Optimization

## Project Overview
This project focuses on determining whether specific website modifications led to a statistically significant increase in conversion rates. It demonstrates the ability to combine rigorous statistical testing with business-ready visualization.

## Workflow & Features
* **Data Preparation:** Used Python to clean and validate A/B test groups (Control vs. Variant).
* **Statistical Analysis:** Applied `scipy.stats` to calculate P-Values and verify the Null Hypothesis.
* **Tableau Dashboard:** [Link to Tableau Public Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/jan.cwirko/viz/PortfolioProjectSalesAnalysis/StatisticalInsights)
* **Visuals:** Includes `Dashboard_Overview.png` showing key metric distributions and segment performance.

## Final Recommendation
Based on the lack of statistical significance (P-Value > 0.05), the recommendation was to iterate on the test design rather than implementing the current variant.
